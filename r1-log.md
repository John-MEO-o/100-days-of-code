Next day I'll set a media queries

### R4D10
My portfolio site is ready, based on freeCodeCamp conditions... 
Perfectionism is infinite process, 
and my learning are too, but they're parallel, so I'll not continue to promoting UX / UI metrics to its best values, 
I need to go further!

### R1D11
I assumed my web design curriculum part would be over with developed Portfolio site, 
but it seems I'll need to develop all page variants to finish it.

### R4D17
Hooray, I've finished Web Responsive design curriculum chapter, 
last two days were tough on daily work...
so now I'm diving in Javascript part at last!)

### R1D18
I've started to learn the JS Basics, for now I've complete 25% of the first curriculum part (110 tasks).
There's a lot of interesting examples, trying to closer understanding of it.

### R2D19
I'm solving JS Basics tasks, 
so I've passed an arrays: 
- how to store values inner;
- how to remove them...
then was a functions:
- how to call;
- how to check whether variable used as global or as local namespace;
- how to use arguments;
- how to return results of execution
and so on, it was a very helpful lesson after my php experience

### R3D20
I feel that the tasks are getting more complicated - it's nice!
Today I passed the function comparison operators and switch use cases - I saw this statement earlier in PHP
so the learning process was pretty soft for me until I started the Counting Cards lesson
Tomorrow I'll try to solve it, good luck to everyone who codes at night))

### R4D21
I finally solved the CardCounter task. This problem was not solved with impudence, so I had to sit and think about its solution. A few tricky things was on it)
Tommorow I'll start to learn objects and its properties! Thanks to everybody who's cheering me up in this challendge!

### R5D22
A lot of interesting examples being reviewed in this JS Curriculum, I'm on 80% of completion now.

### R6D23
I'm stuck at the Record Collection task, 
its conditions required to use a complex of achieved programming skills, 
at this moment my brain aren't ready to get a quick solution

### R7D24
JS is not so simple, 
I'm stuck on Nesting Loops task, 
There's a lot of interesting and complicated nuances on this part of curriculum

### R8D25
I hangs over MultiplierTask, I tried to use multiple nested checks but it didn't help in any way
So I'll check another way later, sad that long time being wasted

### R9D26

will continue tomorrow from "Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range" task

### R10D27
